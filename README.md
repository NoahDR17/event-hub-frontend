## Testing

### Test Case: Updating Profile with Musician Fields

**Title:**

Basic User Upgrading to Musician ‚Äì Validate Inclusion of Musician Fields

**Objective:**

Verify that when a basic user changes their role to "musician" and submits the profile form with musician-specific fields (i.e., "genres" and "instruments"), the update is successful and the musician fields are stored and returned in the API response.

**Pre-requisites:**

- The user must be logged in as a basic user.

- The profile edit UI is accessible.

**Test Steps:**

1. **Log In as a user with role of "basic"**

- Log in to the application with a basic user account.

- Ensure that the user‚Äôs current role is "basic".

2. **Navigate to Profile Edit Page**

- Open the profile edit form where the user‚Äôs current information is loaded from the backend.

3. **Change Role to Musician**

- In the role selection dropdown, change the role from "basic" to "musician".

- *(Note: This field is enabled only for users with a "basic" role.)*

4. **Enter Musician-Specific Information**

- Fill in the musician-specific fields:

- **Genres:** e.g., "Rock, Jazz"

- **Instruments:** e.g., "Guitar, Piano"

5. **Submit the Form**

- Click the "Save" button to submit the updated profile information.

6. **Inspect the API Response**

- Using developer tools or an API client (like Postman), confirm that the API response includes the updated profile data.

- Check for the following:

- The **role** field is now set to "musician".

- The **genres** and **instruments** fields contain the values entered.

- The response includes all expected fields for a musician profile.

7. **Verify Backend**

- Refresh the profile view or perform a GET request on the profile endpoint to ensure that the musician fields are permanently stored and returned correctly.

**Expected Result:**

- The profile update should be successful.

- The returned profile data must include the role as "musician" and display the musician-specific fields (**genres** and **instruments**).

- The UI and API response should reflect the changes correctly.

### Actual Result (Before the Fix)

The old `get_serializer_class` method was implemented as follows:

```python
def get_serializer_class(self):
    """
    Return a serializer without musician-specific fields for non-musicians.
    """
    profile = self.get_object()
    if profile.role != 'musician':
        class NonMusicianProfileSerializer(ProfileSerializer):
            class Meta(ProfileSerializer.Meta):
                fields = [
                    field for field in ProfileSerializer.Meta.fields
                    if field not in ['genres', 'instruments']
                ]
        return NonMusicianProfileSerializer
    return ProfileSerializer
- **Issue**:
  This implementation only checked the profile‚Äôs current role (via self.get_object()) and did not consider the incoming update data.

  As a result, when a basic user attempted to change their role to "musician" along with filling in genres and instruments, the serializer used during the PUT request excluded those fields.

  Consequently, only the role changed while the musician-specific fields were omitted.

- **Solution Implemented**
I updated the get_serializer_class method to distinguish between PUT (update) requests and GET requests.
The new method first checks the incoming request data for PUT requests.

python
def get_serializer_class(self):
    # For edit/update requests, check the role in the incoming data.
    if self.request.method == 'PUT':
        if self.request.data.get('role') == 'musician':
            return ProfileSerializer
        else:
            # Otherwise, use a serializer without musician-specific fields.
            class NonMusicianProfileSerializer(ProfileSerializer):
                class Meta(ProfileSerializer.Meta):
                    fields = [
                        field for field in ProfileSerializer.Meta.fields
                        if field not in ['genres', 'instruments']
                    ]
            return NonMusicianProfileSerializer

    # For GET requests (and any other non-PUT requests), use the current profile role.
    profile = self.get_object()
    if profile.role != 'musician':
        class NonMusicianProfileSerializer(ProfileSerializer):
            class Meta(ProfileSerializer.Meta):
                fields = [
                    field for field in ProfileSerializer.Meta.fields
                    if field not in ['genres', 'instruments']
                ]
        return NonMusicianProfileSerializer

    return ProfileSerializer

The serializer now checks self.request.data for the role value.
If the incoming role is "musician", the full ProfileSerializer (which includes genres and instruments) is returned.
Otherwise, a modified serializer that excludes these fields is used.
For GET (and other) requests:

The current profile role (from self.get_object()) is used to determine which serializer to return.
Outcome
With the updated method:

When a basic user changes their role to "musician" and provides musician-specific information, the full serializer is used during the PUT request.
This ensures that the musician fields are included in both the response and the saved profile data.
Conclusion
After redeploying the backend with the updated get_serializer_class method, I re-ran the test.

‚úÖ The profile now correctly updates the role to "musician" and includes the genres and instruments fields in the response.

‚úÖ The updated musician information persists, confirming that the solution works as expected.

### Manual Test Case: Ensure Comments Are Unique to Their Event

**Objective:**

Verify that a comment created on one event is displayed **only** on that event and **not** on any other.

**Test Steps:**

1. **Create a Comment on Event A**

- Go to the detail page for Event A.

- Create a new comment.

- Confirm that the comment appears on Event A's page.

2. **Check a Different Event**

- Navigate to the detail page for Event B (or any event other than Event A).

- Verify that the comment from Event A is **not displayed** on Event B's page.

**Expected Result:**

- The comment should **only appear on Event A** and must **not** show up on Event B.

**Actual Result (Before Fix):**

- Comments were **not filtered by event**, meaning comments from Event A were also displayed on Event B.

**Solution Implemented:**

- The issue was resolved by integrating the **Django Filter Backend** into the Comments API, which now filters comments based on the event ID.

**Outcome:**

- After deploying the fix, comments are now correctly associated with their respective events, ensuring that they **do not appear on unrelated event pages**.
